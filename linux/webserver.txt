Creating Your Own Website
    We can modify its content in /var/www/html or 
    settings by editing its Virtual Host file found in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf.

    sudo mkdir /var/www/gci/
    We have it named gci here but any name will work, as long as we point to it in the virtual hosts configuration file later.

    cd /var/www/gci/
    nano index.html

    <html>
    <head>
    <title> Ubuntu rocks! </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <p> I'm running this website on an Ubuntu Server server!
    </body>
    </html>

Now let’s create a VirtualHost file so it’ll show up when we type in gci.example.com.

Setting up the VirtualHost Configuration File
    We start this step by going into the configuration files directory:
    cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
    
    Since Apache came with a default VirtualHost file, let’s use that as a base. 
    (gci.conf is used here to match our subdomain name):
    sudo cp 000-default.conf gci.conf

    Now edit the configuration file:
    sudo nano gci.conf

    We should have our email in ServerAdmin so users can reach you in case Apache experiences any error:
    ServerAdmin yourname@example.com

    We also want the DocumentRoot directive to point to the directory our site files are hosted on:
    DocumentRoot /var/www/gci/

    The default file doesn’t come with a ServerName directive so we’ll have to add and define it by adding this 
    line below the last directive:
    ServerName gci.example.com

    This ensures people reach the right site instead of the default one when they type in gci.example.com.

Now that we’re done configuring our site, let’s save and activate it in the next step!

Activating VirtualHost file
    After setting up our website, we need to activate the virtual hosts configuration file to enable it. 
    We do that by running the following command in the configuration file directory:
    sudo a2ensite gci.conf

    To load the new site, we restart Apache by typing:
    service apache2 reload
